# Shopping-app
TRENDIFY is an e-commerce application developed as a university project using Flutter, supporting both Android and iOS platforms. The application aims to provide a secure and integrated shopping experience for users, combining ease of use, reliability, and a wide range of features tailored for both stores and customers.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a cross-platform e-commerce application.
- Provide a secure user experience through authentication and identity verification.
- Manage products and orders in a structured and real-time manner via a cloud database.
- Deliver a modern interface with light/dark mode support.

## Application Features
- **Authentication & Security:**
  The application relies on Firebase Authentication to ensure secure login. Users can create accounts using their phone numbers and receive verification codes via SMS. The system also validates all authentication cases such as duplicate emails or usernames during registration.
- **Data Management:**
  Firestore Database is used to add and update store data, including products and orders, ensuring seamless and accurate performance.
- **Shopping & Orders:**
  Users can browse products, make direct purchases, track ongoing orders, and view previous ones easily.
- **Inventory Management:**
  Each product has a defined quantity that is updated in real time. Out-of-stock items are clearly displayed as unavailable.
- **User Interface:**
  A modern design with support for light/dark modes to enhance user experience and comfort.
- **Financial Security:**
  Full bank card details are never stored. Only the last four digits of the card number and its expiration date are saved, ensuring high security and privacy.
